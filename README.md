# UFOs

## Overview
This project utilizes HTML and JavaScript to create a website displaying UFO sitings. Filters were added for date, city, state, country, and shape, so that the user could more easily drill down on the exact types of instances they wanted to see. 

## Results
In order to perform a search, the user may add a filter to any of the available fields (date, city, state, country, and/or shape) and press enter/return on their keyboard. Doing this will filter the instances for those specific fields.

## Summary
This design could be improved by taking into account the user experience. Below are several possible editions that would transform the user experience on this page:
- Case Sensitivity: Right now, the input fields are case sensitive. Adding code to manage both upper and lower case inputs would enable the user to input both types of letters without causing an error. 
- Prepopulated Fields:Having prepopulated fields in the text boxes would help the user avoid spelling mistakes and/or syntax errors. There is an example in the text box, but a user still can type colorado, Colorado, CO, co, or accidentally include spelling mistakes. Having prepopulated fields would help the user avoid any errors in their input prior to clicking run.
- Button: A button could be added for the user to click once they have typed in the fields that they are interested in. This would allow the user to know whether the code/website was retrieving data or not.
